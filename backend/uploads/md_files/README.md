# The Isles of Perdition  
*A D&D 5e Campaign for Levels 1–5*  
*By [Your Name]*  

---

## Introduction  
**Setting**: The Shattered Archipelago, a chain of islands slowly sinking into the Shadowfell. Once a thriving realm guarded by celestial beings, the isles are now cursed. Their corruption manifests as creeping shadows, restless spirits, and monstrous entities born of the plane's decay.  

**Themes**: Gothic maritime horror, survival against environmental decay, and moral choices in the face of desperation.  

### Key Lore  
- **The Celestial Guardians**: Ancient seraphs known as the Luminaries once protected the isles. Their absence has left the islands vulnerable.  
- **The Drowning Ritual**: A cabal of shadow-worshiping cultists (the **Eclipsed Cabal**) seeks to merge the archipelago with the Shadowfell, drowning all life in darkness.  
- **Factions**:  
  - **The Tidewardens**: Fisherfolk and druids fighting to purify the land.  
  - **The Eclipsed Cabal**: Cultists sacrificing islands to empower their shadow overlord, **Umbrak the Devourer**.  
  - **The Ghostfleet**: Undead pirates trapped between realms, raiding for souls.

## Adventure Background  
**The Call to Action**:  
The party arrives at **Port Mourning**, the last bastion of civilization. The Tidewardens plead for aid: the nearby island of **Blackreef** has vanished overnight, leaving only a swirling vortex of shadow. If the ritual isn’t stopped, the entire archipelago will follow.  

**The MacGuffin**:  
A relic called the **Luminary’s Beacon**, split into three fragments, is the only tool capable of halting the Drowning Ritual. The fragments are hidden in cursed locations:  
1. **The Sunken Cathedral** (Blackreef’s ruins)  
2. **The Ashen Lighthouse** (A volcanic island guarded by fire elementals)  
3. **The Hollow Citadel** (A fortress overrun by the Ghostfleet)

## Part 1: The Vanishing of Blackreef  
**Hook**: The Tidewardens hire the party to investigate Blackreef’s disappearance.  

### Key Locations  
1. **Port Mourning**  
   - **NPCs**:  
     - **Captain Mara Voss** (Tidewarden leader): A gruff triton paladin.  
     - **Old Finn** (Crazy fisherman): Claims to have seen "shadow whales" devour the island.  
   - **Quest**: Secure a ship and crew for the voyage.  

2. **The Shadow Vortex**  
   - A mile-wide whirlpool of dark water. At its center lies the submerged **Sunken Cathedral**.  
   - **Encounter**: Shadow Mastiffs (MM 230) stalk the deck during the voyage.  

---

## Part 2: The Sunken Cathedral  
**Dungeon Overview**: A flooded temple with shifting corridors. The first fragment is guarded by a **Drowned Luminary** (reskinned **Revenant**, MM 259).  

### Encounters  
- **Room 1: The Nave**  
  - **Hazard**: Rising water forces a DC 13 Athletics check every round. Failure = 1d6 bludgeoning damage from debris.  
  - **Monster**: **Shadow Wraiths** (Appendix A) emerge from murky pools.  

- **Room 3: The Altar of Light**  
  - **Puzzle**: Align shattered stained glass to focus moonlight (Intelligence DC 15).

## Part 3: The Ashen Lighthouse  
**Hook**: The second fragment is held by **Ignis**, a paranoid fire elemental trapped in a volcanic lighthouse.  

### Key Challenges  
- **Encounter: Magma Mephits** (MM 215) ambush the party on the ascent.  
- **Negotiation**: Ignis demands a "worthy offering" (e.g., a magic weapon) in exchange for the fragment.  
- **Hazard**: Periodic eruptions force Dexterity saves (DC 14) to avoid 2d6 fire damage.  

---

## Part 4: The Hollow Citadel  
**Final Dungeon**: A spectral fortress haunted by **Captain Vrynn**, Ghostfleet commander (reskinned **Wraith**, MM 302).  

### Climactic Battle  
- **Phase 1**: Fight Captain Vrynn and **Specter** crewmates.  
- **Phase 2**: The Beacon’s activation awakens **Umbrak’s Avatar** (Appendix B), a CR 8 shadow dragon.  

**Epilogue**: With the Beacon restored, the vortex collapses. Port Mourning is saved... for now.
