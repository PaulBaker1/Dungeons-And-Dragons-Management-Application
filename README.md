# RPG Session Manager

A next-generation, web-based platform for managing tabletop RPG sessions with maximum flexibility, intuitive UI, and seamless integration.  
Built for Game Masters and Players alike.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Traditional RPG session tools suffer from:
- Lack of flexibility in gameplay and management
- Unintuitive interfaces
- Poor scalability & limited integration with other tools

**Our solution:**  
A comprehensive web application that empowers both Game Masters (GMs) and Players with a modern, integrated environment for RPG sessions.
